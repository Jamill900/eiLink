        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>In 2015, aiming to develop research capability in education, Khazar University and a group of professionals
            from Oil and Gas Industry collaboratively established eiLink R&D Center (which stands for Education to
            Industry Link). The initial idea behind this center was to create a mutual opportunity for Education and
            Industry to benefit from each other through collaborative research and scientific studies.
            <br />
            <br />
            Today eiLink is much more than research and development centers, it is a business unit that provides
            value-added services addressing customers' emerging technical and technological challenges. Here, ideas,
            studies, and developments turn into brand-new R&D products and Innovative Solutions that have direct and
            tangible links to the industry and business.

        <h1>Our Vision</h1>
        <p><strong>To become a partner of choice R&D Center in the country.</strong>
            <br />
            <br />
            Activities at eiLink R&D Center are focused on high-quality researchers, which is fundamental for the
            delivery of sophisticated technical solutions, services, and products driven by applicable, publishable, and
            commercially viable results.Their eager desire for a more nuanced understanding of fundamental and applied
            science is a powerful motivation for research. The compelling driver, however, is the pursuit of commercial
            success. To support the paradigm shift of R&D in the country, eiLink R&D Center seeks to foster an
            environment in which these forces can interact and reinforce one another.
