                    <p>It is common during field development that certain areas of the structure, while containing
                        appreciable oil and gas reserves, are complicated and negatively affected by certain geological
                        features. Sometimes, vital information regarding reservoir properties and characterization is
                        difficult or impossible to obtain from these regions for various reasons, which may
                        include:
                        <br><br>
                        1. The scale of these geological features is below conventional well log resolution, requiring
                        complex core acquisition or other expensive petrophysical techniques;
                        <br>
                        2. Drilling these geological regions is too expensive for the uncertainty associated with the
                        reservoir properties degradation caused by these geological features;
                        <br>
                        3. The spatial distribution of such geological features is too complex to understand and design
                        an economically viable field development plan.

                        In the scenarios mentioned above, outcrop analog studies may help significantly enhance the
                        subsurface understanding and help build a successful field development strategy. They can serve
                        as a starting point toward characterization of reservoirs without spending much money on
                        expensive data acquisition and surveillance.

                        In the Deep Water Gunashli (DWG) oil field, the complex, steeply dipping northern limb of the
                        structure has historically been underdeveloped due to the presence of severe reservoir
                        properties degradation associated with deformation bands. Recently, an appraisal campaign has
                        been launched to understand the reservoir potential in this area. The vital part of this
                        campaign was the Yasamal Analogue Outcrop Study done by the eiLink Team.

                    <br>
                    <p>The objective of the outcrop study during the first phase of the project was to acquire abundant
                        geological information, including:
                        <br><br>
                        · Dip angle/dip azimuth measurements along and across the stratigraphy using a field

                        <br>
                        · Distribution and number of deformation bands per unit area;
                        <br>
                        · Gamma Ray log across the stratigraphy using a portable Gamma Ray tool;
                        <br>
                        · Permeability measurements from deformed and undeformed rocks using portable permeameters;
                        <br>
                        · Collection of numerous core plugs was acquired for further XRD analysis using a portable core
                        acquisition tool.

                    <p>Then, during the second phase of the project, the focus was to QC the acquired data and use it to
                        come up with an essential geological analysis. The main objective was to observe what controls
                        the presence and distribution of deformation bands in the outcrops. Finally, a similar analysis
                        was made using subsurface data acquired from wells drilled in similar geological settings within
                        the DWG structure with the aim to compare observations between outcrop and subsurface data.
                        <br><br>
                        To achieve the above-mentioned objectives, the acquisition of data was done, ensuring the most
                        representative data was acquired. For instance, only steeply dipping regions of the outcrop were
                        chosen as study locations, where data was mainly acquired along stratigraphy to mimic the
                        subsurface setting. Prior to acquiring the data, the outcrop was cleaned from dust and other
                        undesirable material to ensure accuracy. The tools were calibrated such that no errors were made
                        due to tools reading inadequate information.

                    <br><br>
                    <p>The impact of this project was that vital geological insights and conclusions were drawn and used
                        for the future reservoir characterization of the steeply dipping North Limb of the DWG
                        structure. For instance, it was observed that there is a cut-off value of the Vshale derived
                        from the GR log, indicating the presence of deformation bands as a function of shale content.
                        Also, there is a good relationship between dip angle (which can be viewed as a proxy for how
                        much deformation rocks have been exposed to) and the distribution of deformation bands per unit
                        area. Finally, it was observed that broadly, the conclusions drawn in the outcrop environment
                        honor the subsurface data from wells drilled in this part of the DWG area.

                    <p>Estimation of the recovery factor from structurally deformed areas is a challenging process due
                        to the high number of unknown parameters. These features are of subseismic scale, which are
                        usually observed in sandstones and tend to deteriorate rock properties.
                        <br><br>
                        The goal is to build a 3D simulation model of the Yasamal sandstone layer with the distribution
                        of deformation bands and evaluate their impact on fluid flow, recovery factor, and percentage of
                        poorly swept grid cells. This approach is recognized as valid since the rocks of Yasamal
                        Valley’s outcrops are accepted as analogous to the formations of offshore fields in the South
                        Caspian Basin. Patterns of deformation bands are met at the East Limb of Yasamal structure,
                        which was the main target area during the study.

                        precipitation intensity data of the last 40 years of the Hajigabul-Padarchol agricultural area,
                        and the preliminary analysis of surface flows and flood events formed in the mountainous area.
                        It consists of research work on the preparation of a 3D simulation model, the preliminary
                        analysis of groundwater and the study of irrigation potential. The groundwater potential of the

                    <p>Significant water reserves have been found in depths below 300 meters. The water due to the
                        geological setting is considered saline and unconfined, so the new well drilling, water
                        extraction using pumps and desalination costs have been estimated. The chemical content of the
                        runoff water coming from the nearby mud volcano is considered unsafe to use for irrigation
                        purposes, and it is proposed to redirect the channels coming from that area, which will increase
                        the productivity of the actual irrigation lands. A 3D topographical model, as well as a flooding
                        event simulation, have been created by the BSU researchers. The amount of average rain
                        precipitation has been estimated and forecasted with detailed probability statistics. With water
                        collected from flooding, 150 hectares of arable land can be provided with irrigation water. In
                        order to collect rainwater, 5–6 ponds with a useful volume of 120–180 thousand cubic meters each
                        should be created. A system of catchment canals with a total length of 80 km should be
                        established to direct rainwater to the ponds. Considering the geometry of the land, the flood
                        water management map has been created.
